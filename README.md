# Lack of electric car charging points 'putting off drivers'

In March 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47696839) a "patchy" network of charging points was discouraging UK drivers from embracing electric cars.

Our analysis found more than a third of local authorities had ten or fewer locations where drivers could plug in their vehicles, with wide variation across the country.

We analysed data from Open Charge Map, a crowd-sourced website of charging locations. Not every location will feature in Open Charge Map, but it aims to be a "reliable single point of reference for charging equipment location information". There is no similar resource from the government.

As part of the story we used the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to perform 49 million calculations for each distance (as the crow flies) between each of the 7,000 points, and then store the shortest one. 

This piece of content was produced by a regional newspaper reporter working alongside BBC staff.

In a Twitter thread, Peter Sherlock [explained why the data was used and how the team worked with that](https://twitter.com/petesherlock79/status/1114089816671563777)
